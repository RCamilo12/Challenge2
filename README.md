MODULE 2 CHALLANGE STOCKS
Juan Camilo Boh√≥rquez Rozo

This program analyzes the year change and percentage change of stock tickers throughout different years. It also returns which ticker had the greatest increase and which had the greatest decrease, as well as the total stock value of the year and the greatest one.
My program had some issues with calculating the Total Stock Volume and I also could not bring back the greatest increase and decrease tick symbol.
